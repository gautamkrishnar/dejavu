# Dejavu
The term **déjà vu** is French and means, literally, "already seen." Those who have experienced the feeling describe it as an overwhelming sense of familiarity with something that shouldn't be familiar at all. Say, for example, you are traveling to England for the first time. You are touring a cathedral, and suddenly it seems as if you have been in that very spot before. Or maybe you are having dinner with a group of friends, discussing some current political topic, and you have the feeling that you've already experienced this very thing -- same friends, same dinner, same topic.

Just like that, the aim of this project is to develop a hack proof system that reacts intelligently to cyber attacks by the application of advanced machine learning techniques.

### The system will be able to
* Detect the attack vectors
* Classify the attacks based on the severity and previous knowledge
* Take necessary actions to reduce the harm of the attack vectors
* Notifies the admin about the attack
* Can do counter attacks without any human interaction
* Self learn the new techniques to prevent attacks
* Automaticially gather the information about the attacker

### Status
This project is still under development
